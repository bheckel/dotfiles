  # fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
  # When this happens, inspect why the branches diverged. Sometimes, you may discover that you made a mistake, like trying to pull master into a local branch. In cases where you really did intend to create a merge commit, you can now follow with git merge. By doing this, you perform the "downloading" and the "committing" in two different steps, which helps mentally separate these two operations.
