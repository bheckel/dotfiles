  # "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting."
  # Inspect why the branches diverged. You may discover that you made a
  # mistake, like trying to pull master into a local branch. In cases where
  # you did intend to create a merge commit, you can now follow with git
  # merge. You then perform the "downloading" and the "committing" in two
  # different steps, which helps mentally separate these two operations.
